# ClassGenerator

ClassGenerator is a GUI program (in french) written in C++ with Qt library.

This is a graphical tool that will help you to generate automatically a C++ class source code.

The idea of this program come from the wonderfull website "Openclassrooms" which is made for beginners to learn programing langages. I've learned C++ from there : https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c

I still have improvements to do, like :
- improve the controls on the class' (and mother-class') name input
- edit the Header Guard (to change it while typing class name)
- add license reference in comments
- add includes
- add attibutes
- add accessors for this attributes
- generate .h AND .cpp code (2 tabs)
- save .h and .cpp files containing this sources


Don't hesitate to sent me coments, ideas or to improve this code by sending me some PR.

Enjoy :)
