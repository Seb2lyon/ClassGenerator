# ClassGenerator

ClassGenerator is a GUI program (in french, english or polish) written in C++ with Qt library.

This tool will help you to generate automatically a basic C++ class code and save the header (.h) and source (.cpp) files.
This is a complete project which means that all the resources are include (images, DLL...).

The idea of this program come from the wonderfull website "Openclassrooms" which is made for beginners to learn programing langages. I've learned C++ from there : https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c

Now you can also download the setup executable file for Windows OS in : https://sourceforge.net/projects/class-generator/

Don't hesitate to sent me coments, ideas or to improve this code by sending me some PR.

Enjoy :)
