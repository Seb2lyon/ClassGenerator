# ClassGenerator

ClassGenerator is a GUI program (in french or english) written in C++ with Qt library.

This is a graphical tool that will help you to generate automatically a simple C++ class source code.

The idea of this program come from the wonderfull website "Openclassrooms" which is made for beginners to learn programing langages. I've learned C++ from there : https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c

Very soon, this software will be fully usable... and the executable file will be available on Sourceforge!

Don't hesitate to sent me coments, ideas or to improve this code by sending me some PR.

Enjoy :)
